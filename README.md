# Mini_Version_Control_Program
This is a program I wrote for my data structures and algorithms course in Fall 2017.  I developed the program from scratch with the only code provided living in utils.java.  

Several basic git commands are supported such as add, commit, remove, find, reset, branch, log, and global log.  I used a series of hashmaps to track files in staging to determine whether files had been changed.  Several basic unit tests are included to test various functions.
